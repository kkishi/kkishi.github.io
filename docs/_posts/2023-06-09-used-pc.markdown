title:  "Used PC"

I recently bought a used PC on Ricardo. It was quite cheap (~115CHF including shipping). I'll be writing down my notes in this page.

## Spec

The machine seems to have been sold as *axxiv EQUILIBRA AQ17010*. I can see similar ones at <https://www.axxiv.ch/>.

* Motherboard: [Q170M2](https://www.asus.com/commercial-motherboard/q170m2/specifications/)
  * Form factor: MicroATX
  * CPU: LGA 1151
  * Memory: DDR4*4 (Max 64GB)
  * Storage: SATA*6
* CPU: [Core i5-6500](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/88184/intel-core-i56500-processor-6m-cache-up-to-3-60-ghz.html)
  * Memory: Max 64GB
  * Graphics: HD Graphics 530
* HDD: [Samsung 850 EVO 250GB](https://www.samsung.com/us/business/support/owners/product/850-evo-series-250gb/)
* PSU: [SS-430GB](https://seasonic.com/s12ii#specification)
* Case: AIO TMJ0103V3 mATX Tower (?)

## Initial inspection

The PC came with two power cables, one for the Switzerland plug and the other for the EU plug. I ran the PC out of the box to check if it's working at all. It brought me to the Windows 10 installation screen, which is convenient. After the installation I was able to do some browsing on the internet, so things seem to be working good.

I then disconnected the PC and started disassembling it a bit. It was super dusty, so I spent some time cleaning it up.

I looks like there's no GPU inside. It turned out that the CPU, Core i5-6500, has an integrated GPU (HD Graphics 530). It was working just fine except that when I played 4K Youtube videos it stuttered a bit. I can use a GT 1030 laying around.

The case had six 3.5 inch HDD cages: five of them were plastic and the other one was metal. It'd be nice if we can get more metal cages.

I then swapped the SSD with a brand new one, connected the 3.5 inch HDD which I've been using as an external drive (formatted as ZFS) and installed Ubuntu.

## Setting up Ubuntu

### ZFS

It didn't mount the ZFS-formatted drive initially, and I needed to run the following command:

```sh
keisuke@ricardo:~$ sudo zpool import tank-mirror
```

Once that's done, the drive is automatically mounted on every run.

### Multimedia reader

This is a nice addition to this already very cheap PC. I tried reading an SD card and it just worked. This thing is awesome as I don't have to look around an external multimedia reader whenever I need to read data from my cameras. Looking forward to use this more.

### Using GT 1030

By default, for GT 1030 the system uses some non-nvidia driver that is quite slow. You can confirm that by:

```sh
keisuke@ricardo:~$ nvidia-smi
NVIDIA-SMI has failed because it couldn't communicate with the NVIDIA driver. Make sure that the latest NVIDIA driver is installed and running.
```

To install the driver, run the following command and restart:

```sh
keisuke@ricardo:~$ sudo apt install nvidia-driver-530
```

You should be able to see that now it uses the nvidia driver:

```sh
keisuke@ricardo:~$ nvidia-smi

### Adding RAM

8GB RAM was getting too tight. Bought [Crucial Pro RAM 32GB Kit (2x16GB) DDR4 3200MHz Desktop Memory CP2K16G4DFRA32A](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0C29R9LNL) for EUR 49.77.
